koopman recursion gets rid of need to invert. supposed to give equivalent results, except for numerical advantages.

bigger impact from panel data than intensive repeated measures.

group process noise and time series parameters.
null condition is a lot worse, other conditions are comparable to each other.
what goes into the koopman and dejong approaches for model-implied, null?

nonstationary model - see whether the two diffuse approaches work better than large kappa for panel data? quality of point estimates and standard error estimation. convergence. 

compared to even other severe misspecifications - like assuming null. not estimating IC is the worst thing you can do. worst thing you can do. 

ask lu to check if gtran part for LDL is implemented correctly.

double check to see free parm conv noSE
